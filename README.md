# Tyiler
An image tiling tool for higher-quality images on ROBLOX.

## Background
This project is something I spent my 2023 summer working on for a few weeks as I was building a map system for [StarSim](https://www.roblox.com/groups/6896773/StarSim-Community-Hub#!/about) that required high-resolution top-down renders of the 3D game worlds.
To get around ROBLOX's upload restrictions on resolution, I figured I'd tile the images with a CLI tool written in Python and then upload them to ROBLOX using [Tarmac](https://github.com/Roblox/tarmac).
This works, and thus Tyiler was born.

Although the workflow and the tool itself require heavy clean-up to make the developer experience easy and quick, and some documentation is required also, I figured I'd make the repository public for anyone who's interest in this approach to automating any-resolution image uploading to ROBLOX.

## Contributing
Currently, I have no intent to continue working on this in the near future so I do not expect any contribution.
However, if there is a desire, I recommend forking the project and making your own contributions there as I do not believe I will be paying enough attention to this repository to manage issues or PR's.
